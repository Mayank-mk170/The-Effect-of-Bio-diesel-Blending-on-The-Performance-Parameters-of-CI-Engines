The experiments conducted: -
Flash Point & Fire Point using Pensky Martens Apparatus, and Measuring Calorific Value using Bomb Calorimeter.

Flash Point: - The lowest temperature at which vapours above a volatile combustible substance ignite in air when exposed to flame is known as Flash Point. 
Fire Point: - The minimum temperature at which a flammable or combustible liquid, as herein defined, and some volatile combustible solids will evolve sufficient vapor to produce a mixture with air that will support sustained combustion when exposed to a source of ignition, such as a spark or flame.
Bomb Calorimeter: - The bomb calorimeter an apparatus primarily used for measuring heats of combustion. The reaction takes place in a closed space known as the calorimeter proper, in controlled thermal contact with its surroundings, the jacket, at constant temperature. By using bomb calorimeter, the calorific values are calculated.
Calorific Value: - Calorific value is defined as the amount of calories generated when a unit amount of substance is completely oxidized and is determined using the bomb calorimeter. The calorific value of coal represents gross calorific value (HG), which contains the latent heat of water vaporization.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE:
	 Fill the oil sump by desire oil with care.
	 Supply the Electrical power source.
	 Open the water supply valve.
	 Start the Diesel Engine by an external handle. Remove the handle and close the valve after engine start continuously.
	 Engine gives start continuously with no load up to 5 mints.
	 Increase the load up to half load or 0.5 Amp.
	 Take necessary data as Head difference from manometer, Engine speed by tachometer, load in kg, different temperature and fuel consumption time for 5 ml.
	 Increase the load up to full load or 1 Amp and take all data as taken before.
	 Collect all necessary data for the experiment.
	 Stop the engine.
	 For nest experiment, new mixture is made and poured into the oil sump.
	 Start engine as before and note down all data from the experiment.
	 Take all necessary data.
	 Stop the engine.

Where,
T.F.C = Total fuel consumption in kg/hr
S = Specific gravity of fuel
t = Time for 5cc of fuel consumption in sec

	SPECIFIC FUEL CONSUMPTION (S.F.C):

Where,
S.F.C= specific fuel consumption in kg/kw-hr
